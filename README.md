# Autonomous Robotics – Planning and Control

Autonomous robots are designed to perform assigned tasks with minimal human supervision. This requires the robot’s capabilities to perceive its surroundings, find its own location, identify obstacles to avoid, determine the destination to reach, and compute a trajectory to control its motors, maneuvering toward its destination along the computed path.

To achieve this level of autonomy, robotics scientists and engineers must have a deep understanding of the operation of sensors and actuators, as well as the foundations of control and planning necessary to realize autonomous robotic systems. This course introduces the basic tenets of robot planning and control, alongside related concepts in localization, sensing, and perception.
